- [Week 01](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/developer/week01-project01-basics/learning-outcomes/)

Make sure to record evidence of your processes. You can use code snippets, screenshots or any other material to support your answers.

Do not fill in the feedback section. The Founders and Coders team will update this with feedback on your progress.

## Assessment
 ### 1. Show evidence of some of the learning outcomes you have achieved this week.
 The main points of focus for this week were: 
> - Accessibility
> - Design
> - Workflow
> - HTML forms
 
This week I learnt about the foundational blocks to building a website. In terms of accessibility in my team project we focused on and used semantic HTML when structuring our webpage. For design, we used CSS root variables, which was important in implementing our theme changes and worked with our Javascript to do so. Challenges were faced when using GitHub, however our team were cohesive in communicating and figuring out issues that arose. We also used forms successfully, and manged to create an interactive form that also checked whether the fields were filled in correctly or missing.  

 ### 2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
I think there was a struggle in being able to complete all of the learning outcomes/ points to acheive in regards to the project. Though we were successful in our main aim, it would be nice to revisit making our website as accessible as possible such as including a mobile responsiveness, and color contrast. 

## Feedback (For CF's)
> Alexander 
> [*What went well*]
> Looks like you got the basics of the project. It is also good that you experienced issues with GitHub, the sooner the better.
> [*Even better if*]
> Instead of writing a paragraph with all the learnings it will be more organised to create bullet points for each learning. Some learnings will come from the brief while some others will be your own.
Support the learning with code snippets and/or screenshots.
Also remember that an important part of this week was project managing, there is no need to include it on this week but remember to add it to week02.
Also remember that we don't want "the right answers" but your experience. You need to create your own personality as a developer and we all want to see it.
