## Assessment
 ### 1. Show evidence of some of the learning outcomes you have achieved this week.
 The main points of focus for this week were: 
> - Accessibility
> - Design
> - Workflow
> - HTML forms
 
This week I learnt about the foundational blocks to building a website. In terms of accessibility in my team project we focused on and used semantic HTML when structuring our webpage. For design, we used CSS root variables, which was important in implementing our theme changes and worked with our Javascript to do so. Challenges were faced when using GitHub, however our team were cohesive in communicating and figuring out issues that arose. We also used forms successfully, and manged to create an interactive form that also checked whether the fields were filled in correctly or missing.  

 ### 2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
I think there was a struggle in being able to complete all of the learning outcomes/ points to acheive in regards to the project. Though we were successful in our main aim, it would be nice to revisit making our website as accessible as possible such as including a mobile responsiveness, and color contrast.
