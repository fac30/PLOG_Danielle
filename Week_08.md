## Assessment
 ### 1. Show evidence of some of the learning outcomes you have achieved this week.
> **[Learning outcomes...]**  
> [your evidence here]

I would say in the concluding week of our app development, there was still a focus on debugging. In regards to the learning outcomes: 

> - Learn how to write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests using testing frameworks like Cypress 

I would say that I have previous experience in using Cypress and writing tests for another project. Though I did not write tests, I enjoyed using Cypress when I had, and would like to continue building on this in future projects.

> - Understand the importance of code organisation, modularity, and reusability

Using a React framework meant that there was no option but to think about how you could resuse code, refactor code, and how best to organise code. For example, in creating a gallery component I originally used it twice in my app component but when it came time to refactor I realised that it was not best practice to do so. 

> - Solidify typescript skills

I would say that I managed to increase my understanding of typescript, and even managed to create an 'Artist types interface' that could be imported into components. 

> - Understand the differences between development, staging, and production environments

I would say I have a resonably good understanding of the difference processes of the differences in enviroments. It is something I would like to further put into practice. 

> - Have good working understanding of the permissions involved when deploying on AWS

Using AWS to create permissions was not as challenging as I anticipated. I managed to create a person profile and a team successfully, and futher attribute specific security permissions to them. I understood why a developer team might want to do this, and the pros of establishing permissions and roles early on. 

> - Understand the basic syntax of provisioning resources with AWS CDK

I found the workshop that helped me to use the AWS CDK pipeline was clear enough to understand, HOWEVER I would not say it gave clear theory or instruction as to why I was doing the tasks I was doing. Though I managed to deploy and then delete my project with the CDK successfully, the documentation felt like going through the motions without the reasons as to why. 

> - Gain experience in using a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline

I understand what CI/CD does in theory, but would not say I have personal practical experience with this. 


 ### 2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
> [**Learning outcome...**]  
> [your evidence here]

I think I have a rough overview and idea of dev ops, and have enjoyed learning about it and using the workshops, but I cannot say my comprehension goes into depth. I am comfortable enough to ask questions, but do not find it a priority for me to go further and practice my knowledge.
